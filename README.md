# viti990-codecrafters-http-server-python
HTTP server made from scratch!!!
made while learning VIM motions on VSCode and learning about all the GitHub commands,
following some steps in the challenge, also learned about some cool features of curl,
bash the structure of HTTP 1.1 and "multi-threading" in python.
Overall a very nice experience!! Stoked to learn more.
